        aries: ["Communicate your feelings early in the day, because by evening you might feel too restricted to want to communicate with anyone. Use this disciplined, sober tone to get a realistic perspective on the issues at hand. You'll have a stable, practical attitude for dealing with any situation. Take a slow, well-calculated approach in order to overcome whatever hurdle is in your way.", "There's a serious tone to the day, Aries, so take this into account when you get the urge to play a practical joke on a friend. Keep things real. Stick close to home and take care of any menial tasks. Start a garden or buy some plants for your house. You have a disciplined nature that will help you get things done.", "Take the unconventional approach today, Aries. You're able to gain a great deal and establish a whole new perspective just by opening your lens wider in order to include what you normally shrug off. Your emotions may be on edge, and the slightest thing may set you off on a rampage. Try your best to keep your cool. Emotional stability is the key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.", " Your ascent up the career ladder might necessitate a bit of careful maneuvering. Mercury is slowing down to spin retrograde in Capricorn and your 10th House of Professional Goals, so for the next few weeks, you may need to rework previous projects in order to ensure that they're fully up to snuff. You'd be wise to set new ideas to the side, as they will likely putter out before reaching any finish lines. Instead, focus on fixing any imperfect work you've already done.", "Your best intentions might not be enough to make the day work in your favor. You're ready and willing to go for gold as the Sun visits your 10th House of Ambition, but its sideswiping angle to Mars in your communications sector could distract you from the work at hand. If there are countless little tasks or numerous people clamoring for your attention, try to accept that bigger projects may need to wait for another time. This is about the little things!", "Go on and get comfortable, Aries! The Moon is settling down in your luxurious 2nd house, which is all about enjoying the finer things in life. If you're planning to hit the town later then dress to the nines. Even if your plans are simply to stay on the couch, make an effort to add in a little luxury. Good food, good drink and even some aesthetic loungewear or your comfiest pajamas might be the perfect way to welcome in the new year."],
        taurus: ["Today is a day of opposites for you. You may jump from one thing to another, Taurus. Somehow nothing seems to sit right with you, and so your search intensifies. Try to be the active one in the situation as opposed to the one acted upon. There is the potential for you to get knocked about, but you can easily turn this around by striking the first blow.", "Things will get much easier and more controlled as the day progresses, Taurus. People's superficial attitudes and idle chatter will give way to more realistic and deep-seated conversations as the evening hours draw near. You will find that it's much easier to get to the heart of the issues and be more honest and realistic about your emotions tonight. Assess your feelings with a practical perspective.", " Bring stability to your emotions today, Taurus. You have the tendency to take things to extremes, swinging from incredible highs to rock-bottom lows. Give your nervous system a break and calm down. Go for a walk in the woods. Make sure that all your actions are rational and well planned. See to it that you're in control of your emotions before you interact with others.", "The world might seem a bit smaller than usual. Mercury is hanging up its hat and hitting the snooze button as it begins retrograding through your expansive 9th house. Normally, when the messenger planet visits this sector, you can feel free and easy -- contrarily, its retrograde here may leave you seemingly bereft of the room you need to move around. Don't feel as if you must stand still and let the world acclimate. Once things settle down, you can spread your wings and fly again.", "Great ideas may seem magical right now, but they still need you to have the cash in the bank to make them happen. An awkward alignment between the powerful Sun in your adventurous 9th house and stubborn Mars in your financially focused 2nd house could force you to hold your horses when you'd rather go careening off into the sunset. Check your accounts before you start planning your escapades to give yourself a good idea of what you're working with first and foremost.", "Don't be surprised if you get an unexpected burst of energy in the immediate future. The Moon is flying into your sign, imbuing you with glorious excitement. Take advantage of this to do as you please, rather than waiting to see what everyone else is doing. You've got permission to make your own plans first -- if others want to spend time with you, then they can hop on your bandwagon. No one knows how to enjoy themselves quite like a Taurus!"],
        gemini: ["Today is a terrific day for you, Gemini, in which action spells reward. You can't go wrong by expressing your needs and how they fit with the collective agenda. Feel free to focus on you and be selfish about your passions. Be aware that unexpected events may crop up to remind you that number one is indeed important, but don't forget about numbers two, three, and so on.", "Today may be a rough day in which you find it hard to decide about anything. Refrain from making any major moves regarding finances or real estate. Concentrate on you and the answers will come from within. Be realistic and practical when it comes to your emotions. You may find it hard to connect with someone tonight, so stick close to home and focus inward.", "- Take care of your home today, both physically and emotionally. See that bills are paid, and the bedroom is tidy. Don't forget to clean the dust from under your bed and the demons from inside your mind. Realize that you might be running on someone else's operating system that got stuck in your hard drive. Make sure you replace it with your own software before you continue.", "It's important to tread lightly where other people are concerned. Your ruler Mercury has just turned retrograde in your 8th House of Shared Resources, meaning you're more than likely to encounter (or start) arguments regarding what belongs to whom. There's no such thing as being too careful about making assumptions, because you could quickly get the wrong idea -- especially when it comes to any financial bonds. What seems like a wise budgeting decision could wind up being a very poor investment.", "Pushing too hard could wind up biting you in the behind at any moment. The Sun is in your extreme 8th house, which can rile up your deepest feelings -- plus, as it aggrieves fiery Mars in your sign, your reactions could wind up being bigger than even you could have ever anticipated. No matter how emotional you are, be wary of overreacting. The people around you will probably remember your behavior, and it might reflect poorly on you down the line. Temper your reactions.", "Life is but a dream today. The Moon is entering your magical 12th house, a special sector of your chart that deals with mysticism and release. She's making this the perfect moment to let go of any past drama that might be weighing you down. Think about what you don't want to follow you into the new year, and make a point to leave it all behind. Write a list of everything you wish to release and dispose of it with meaningful intent."],
        cancer: ["Egos may rage out of control today, leaving you to wonder what all the fuss is about. Give other people their space, Cancer. If the conversation gets too boring, just smile and nod. There may be a great deal of tension among people who are fighting about how much they can get versus how much they give. Try to maintain a healthy balance. Don't get caught in other people's drama.", "You might find it hard to connect with anyone on a deep and meaningful level today, Cancer, so just free yourself and have a good time. Take a more refined and disciplined approach to your projects. You will find that you can be productive after sundown. Later you should consider snuggling up close to someone you trust and care about deeply.", "Go ahead and act confidently, Cancer. You will probably find that you're more stable and grounded in general, leaving you free to explore and take more risks than you normally would. Your intuition may be strong, so don't hesitate to rely on it. Make sure your actions are clear and decisive. You have a great deal of power, so use it wisely.", "Your most important relationships may require a bit of extra care for the foreseeable future. Mercury is turning retrograde in your partnership sector for the next three weeks, making it nearly impossible to get on the same page with the people you're normally totally compatible with. Don't waste your energy trying to strengthen your bonds, because it'll probably just create growing pains. Contracts are better off un-signed as well -- you should get a better bargain down the road when Mercury turns direct.","Don't be shocked if it seems like everyone but you knows what's going on today. Be wary of the clash between the Sun in your partnership sector and Mars in your subconscious realm, as it may force you to go along with other people's plans, regardless of whether or not you've already got your own in mind. Your day should be easier if you don't try to force any situations to happen. Instead, save your grand ideas for another time."," This is the perfect time to be with the people you cherish. Your 11th House of Socializing is glowing as the Moon arrives for one last visit before the year ends, helping you connect to others, near and far. If you're fielding numerous invitations, feel free to show up at as many of them as you can! You should have lots of fun being a social butterfly at any and all of them -- particularly if you know there will be a crowd."],
        leo: ["Today is a powerful day for you, Leo. Your emotions may be stubborn but realize the very thing you resist is the very thing you need the most. Consider making a major change that will help bring about a healthier balance between you and the people with whom you associate. It may be time for a whole new outlook on how you deal with your relationships.", "Get the party started early in the day, Leo. You may be running from task to task, but this is OK. You have the ability to get a lot done by multitasking and keeping things light. As the day progresses, however, there will be a veil of restriction that slowly settles over your mood. You may find it harder to communicate your thoughts than it was earlier in the day.", "It may be hard for you to get a project off the ground, Leo. Perhaps this is a sign that it needs to stay there. Take it back to the drawing board. Do some more planning and testing. Make sure that your actions are well thought out. Test the brakes before you drive down the mountain. You will find that you can accomplish a lot today if you stay focused and disciplined.", "You'd be wise to take things gently for the time being, Leo. Your 6th House of Wellness is hosting Mercury Retrograde, which will last for about three weeks. During this period, burning out could sneak up on you at any moment. Be wary of piling more and more things on your plate, because even if things seem manageable, it'll be exponentially harder to balance each new obligation as it arrives. Move through life cautiously and only take on what you must.", "You might have to spend your day behind a desk while everyone else is off having fun. There's a rare angle between the Sun in your responsible 6th house and Mars in your social 11th house, so you may feel as though the pressure is on to perform -- even if no one else is in the same boat. Your best bet would be to plow through your work with careful precision, and once you've completed your tasks, you can go join the party.", "The urge to finish the year on a strong note may strike you at any moment. The Moon is arriving in your 10th House of Career, so even if everyone else is looking forward to having fun later on, you might be much more focused on making your immediate efforts count. Don't force yourself to burn the midnight oil, but there's nothing wrong with putting your best foot forward -- no matter how much everyone wants to go dancing off into the sunset."],
        virgo: ["Today could be an unusual one for you emotionally, Virgo. Your usual easygoing, adaptable nature could be ruffled by people who try to take over projects that you are perfectly qualified to do. In such situations, you would normally retire gracefully to a quiet corner, but now you spread your beautiful wings and let it be known that you should not be overlooked.", " Bring your thoughts down to Earth, Virgo, especially later tonight. You may be flip-flopping through the day like a fish out of water, but suddenly things start to fall into place at sundown. You will find that people are much more caring and sensitive to your mood later this evening. Spend it at home with someone you love. Ground yourself and plan for the upcoming week.", "Finish whatever you didn't wrap up yesterday, Virgo. Use the morning to plan, the afternoon to execute, and the evening to relax. Be conscious of time and your physical and mental limitations. Bring your dreaminess down to Earth and be realistic about goals. Take time to put the extra coat of wax on the car or extra stitch in the fabric. That effort will serve you well in the long run.", "Even if you normally know your own desires like the back of your hand, that might not be the case for the next few weeks. Mercury is tumbling into a new retrograde phase, occurring in your 5th House of Pleasure, so you'll probably feel like the things that normally bring you joy don't have quite the same impact as usual. That doesn't mean your existence must be spartan, but your desires could need to sit on the back burner for a bit.", "Work and play go hand in hand currently. You're primed to live life to the fullest as the Sun swing-dances through your lucky 5th house, but when it stumbles into Mars in your career sector, you may end up feeling as though you're not achieving enough. Don't let this nagging voice get to you! Remind yourself that taking a break from work every once in a while isn't a crime -- in fact, it's a necessity. You can get back to moving mountains later."," There really are few limits for you today, Virgo. The world is opening up as the Moon enters your expansive 9th house, so it's the perfect day to shake things up one last time before the year switches over. Unusual should be the name of the game for tonight's plans, so if you were trying to decide between a quiet dinner or a grand event, pick the one that will have you dancing all night. Don't limit yourself, not now, and not this year."],
        libra: ["Try not to be too arrogant today, Libra, even when you're utterly sure you're right about the given situation. More than likely, you have the correct answers, but it isn't necessary to be strident about it. Unexpected events are coming your way, and you may find that someone is toying with your emotions. Be on guard for people who may want to ruffle your feathers.", "The earlier portion of the day is apt to flow much more smoothly than the later part, Libra. You should get things solidified right off the bat, if possible. Things will be a bit more relaxed and free flowing in the morning, but become a bit more restrictive as the evening sets in. Don't go to bed without making a plan for what you want to accomplish over the next few days.", "Give it a rest today, Libra. Recharge your batteries. Stick close to home and take a load off your feet. Convince someone to give you a massage, or better yet, go to a professional. You deserve a break. Once you're restored, consider all the ramifications of whatever actions you take before you start. Plan your moves carefully. Be strong and decisive not rash and frantic.", "Things might be feeling a bit off at home. Your 4th House of Home and Family is hosting the current Mercury Retrograde, which means you could start butting heads with roommates or family members much more than usual. Changing anything within your four walls isn't a good idea. If you rent, then don't be shocked if your landlord is less understanding about anything from noise complaints to rent issues than usual. This will blow over eventually, and until it does, tread carefully.", "Today might come with a side of cabin fever. The Sun is hunkered down in your 4th House of Family, so you've likely been spending quite a bit of time at home, but this domestic energy receives a shock from the Sun's potentially problematic connection with Mars in your travel sector. Heading off on a great big adventure is easier said than done! If you're dying for a change of scene, then try watching a documentary that can expand your horizons more easily.", "Your year could end on a rather steamy note. The Moon is slipping into your sensual 8th house, so you might prefer to hide away behind closed doors with a desirable individual rather than hitting up a raucous party until the early hours. Don't let anyone else's expectations of what tonight should be get in the way of you closing out the year in whichever way you prefer. It's okay if an intimate experience is more to your taste than something boisterous would be."],
        scorpio: [" People may have an extra spark in their actions and an extra bite in their words today. You will find that you may be better off just walking away from any situation that doesn't feel right. You'd be wise to stay in the background and not worry about anything besides your immediate concerns and daily routine. Try not to rock the boat.", "This may be a frenzied day for you, Scorpio, but it's likely to settle down as evening sets in. It will be a tender night in which you should stick close to home and get organized. If you have any task that requires discipline, you're better off waiting until tonight to do it. Things will run much more smoothly then.", "Feel free to move forward with your plans, Scorpio. This is a great day to act. You've done a great deal of data collecting and analyzing lately. Now is the time to put that information to good use. You're helped by an extra boost of inner confidence and emotional strength. Your grounded, conservative approach will be richly rewarded. You couldn't ask for a more productive day!", "Life is about to pick up the pace, but whether or not it's heading in the right direction is another matter entirely. As Mercury Retrograde begins in your 3rd House of Communications, it gets dangerously easy to drop the ball when it comes to keeping all the threads of your life woven together. Try to maintain a schedule so you don't feel like you're herding cats, but understand that things can slip away despite your efforts to hold down the fort.", "You may bounce back and forth between casual and intense emotions at present. The Sun is in your easy-going 3rd house, making this a lovely time to catch up with friends in your local community, but things could take a turn when the Sun trips over passionate Mars. Mars is in your extreme 8th house, so even if everyone is making fun small talk, you'll have a hard time resisting the urge to discuss serious topics. Try to avoid bringing anyone else down.","You're being invited to close out the year with someone special by your side. Your 7th House of Partnerships is highlighted as the Moon slips in for one last visit before 2022 comes to an end, so you should feel more in tune with things if you've got a partner-in-crime to help you make the final countdown. Whether it's a friend or a lover, you can look forward to having more fun with them than you would by attempting to tackle it on your own."],
        sagittarius: ["Express yourself to the fullest today, Sagittarius. Feel free to take an unconventional approach when it comes to dealing with your emotions. Try not to let others cajole you into thinking you need to fit into an artificial construct of what you need to be and what you need to think. All you need to do is think for yourself. Fight the established norms and be your own person.", "You should be on cloud nine today, Sagittarius. As evening sets in, however, things might get a little too heavy for your comfort. People will have had enough of your gossip by then, so give it a rest. Kick back and plan for the next few days. You might also want to take a more serious approach to your romantic commitments by confirming your feelings about your partner now.", "You may have a hard time getting started today, Sagittarius. This might be a better time to plan. Be realistic and thoughtful in your actions. Be conscious of the steps you need to take to reach a certain goal. When in doubt, take the more conservative route. You will find that there is a great deal of support for that path. Don't get distracted along the way. Stay on target.", "Maintaining a sense of responsibility when it comes to your finances is essential, Sagittarius. Your 2nd House of Income is the setting for Mercury Retrograde, so there could be quite a bit of confusion surrounding money in the weeks to come. Don't leave things to chance! Make a point of going over your accounts with a fine-toothed comb -- if you don't, you could miss some important charges that will lead you into uncomfortable territory. It's better to be safe than sorry.", "Partners of all kinds might be laying on the pressure! The essentials are highlighted as the Sun tours your 2nd House of Values, but someone else blasts into the picture as the Sun makes a rough quincunx to Mars in your 7th House of Relationships. A peer or pal could step forward to derail your productive plans on purpose, or perhaps their good intentions don't exactly match up with their actual efforts. Consider managing things on your own at this time.", "There's no time like the present to set health goals for the year ahead! The Moon is entering your 6th House of Wellness, so you may be more in the mood to do some relaxing yoga or take an invigorating hike rather than party all day and all night. There are still plenty of ways to enjoy yourself without going wild, so don't think that having a healthy day means having a boring one. An early night means a better tomorrow."],
        capricorn: ["It may be hard to deal with the opposing energies today, Capricorn. Conflicting viewpoints and twisted perspectives clash within your world. Your emotions may pin you to one side of the issue, while a powerful force pulls you to believe in a more revolutionary approach. Try to maintain a balance in all situations, especially those that involve the sensitive emotions of others.", "Lie low during the day and try not to get caught up in the frivolous verbiage that dominates the waking hours. After sundown, feel free to speak your mind. You may notice that there is a sober tone and restrictive sensation today that leaves you feeling like you will never be able to break free from your current situation. Don't get caught in this negative mindset.", "Bring your emotions down to Earth today, Capricorn. Your imagination may run away with you. If you don't take a hard look at reality, you may find yourself in big trouble later. The higher you soar, the harder you fall. Make sure you have a working parachute. Be realistic about your current situation and act with confidence. Make sure you have the facts before you set goals and plans.", "Watch out -- you might be acting like a bull in a china shop. The wind shifts unpredictably as Mercury turns retrograde in your usually steady sign, making it too easy to say the wrong thing and stick your foot in your mouth before you even realize you're missing the mark. Be extra vigilant about thinking before you speak and take care when making promises you aren't completely sure you can keep. The more you sign up for, the more mistakes can occur.", "What you want to do and what you have to do are two very different things at the moment. You can put your own needs front and center as the Sun makes its annual visit to your sign, lighting you up from within, but your responsibilities will come calling when the Sun pokes Mars. The red planet is in your 6th House of Work, so a professional issue or other busy matter could demand your attention. Complete your chores before going on any pleasure cruises.", "It's time to emerge from your cocoon. The Moon is dancing into Taurus and your expressive 5th house, inspiring you to tend to your internal needs and make sure that you're feeling good about life. Let yourself indulge -- perhaps by spending a bit more time in front of the mirror, getting spruced up and adding an extra-unique statement piece (or two)! You deserve to shine, so let people see how bright you can be when you stand center stage."],
        aquarius: ["Aquarius, this may prove a challenging day for you. You're used to being the sovereign surrounded by courtiers currying your favor. There's something trying to draw attention away from you, reminding you that there are other people on this planet besides you. An unexpected messenger may crop up to remind you that not everything revolves around your existence.", "Let your fun-loving nature come out to play today, Aquarius. As the day progresses, the clouds are likely to move in. There may be a more restrictive tone to your emotions that could make it difficult to express how you really feel. Focus your attention inward and realize that you can maintain a high level of self-esteem without having to prove anything.", "Try not to be extravagant today, Aquarius. You're much better off lying low. Focus on you and what you need to do. Don't waste your time trying to attract others' attention. Let them deal with themselves while you concentrate on your goals and chores. Tackle all projects with gusto. You will find that you can be very productive as long as you stay focused and calm.", "Don't be shocked if the world seems to have flipped upside down! Mercury, the cosmic communicator, turns retrograde today in your 12th House of the Subconscious. All sorts of topsy-turvy events are on the horizon! The best way to use this transit would be to focus on your mental health by pondering any old habits that ought to be left in the past. Working on these should help you feel much better by the time Mercury turns direct in a few weeks.", "The less you try to control current events, the more you can enjoy yourself, Aquarius. The Sun is spinning through your dreamy 12th house, helping you go with the flow, and its rare connection to Mars in your creativity zone could result in something absolutely lovely. The possibilities for inspiration here are endless! If you've got an artistic bent, definitely let your Muse out to play, because you could produce something absolutely wonderful. Don't think about what you're creating -- just let it happen.", "Partying might not be to your taste tonight -- even if it seems like everyone else is getting ready to go out and celebrate. The Moon is settling down in your 4th House of Family, so you may choose to ring in the new year with your loved ones rather than hitting the town with a large crew. On the other hand, you could open your home to others as a place for festivities (and make them as small or as big as you want)."],
        pisces: ["Take care of yourself and your needs, Pisces. There's an advantage to making sure your emotions are cared for and stable before you try to heal others. Your feelings are powerful and erratic today. You might find that other people try to oppose your beliefs. Stand up for yourself and be strong. Don't wait until the last minute to tell someone exactly how you feel about the situation.", "Your thoughts may be scattered and frantic early in the day, Pisces, but things should settle down by evening. Your emotions will be more stable, and you will be much more disciplined about tasks that need completion. Plan for the next few days and be practical about what you can accomplish. Don't set yourself up for failure by biting off more than you can chew.", "Today is a terrific day in which you should find that things work very smoothly. You have a hardheaded approach that will help you get down to business and get things done. Make sure you're on solid ground before you take the next step upward. You have the ability to reach the summit of many mountains, so don't waste any time. Put on your boots and start climbing.", "Getting on the same page as everyone else may feel like searching for a needle in a haystack. Mercury is going to sleep in your 11th House of Social Groups, so even if you're a talented networker, you'll likely lose your silver tongue for the moment. If you can't seem to find common ground, consider flying solo for the next few weeks -- or, at least, give people the space to get back to you on their own terms. Don't saddle them with heavy expectations.", " A home-related issue could stand in the way of your social life. Due to the uneasy angle between the Sun in your networking sector and Mars in your family sector, no matter how much you were hoping to meet up with your gang, something where you live will probably demand your attention. A family member or roommate might cause some drama, or perhaps you just have too many pressing chores to even think about leaving the house. Inviting people over may solve the problem.", "People probably want you to come out and play! Take advantage of any free hours to get out and see what everyone is up to -- there should be plenty of exciting options available to you as the Moon bounds into your 3rd House of Community. You can go out for the night without a plan and still find lots of cool places to explore, but you may have more fun if you bring a few friends along for the ride."],
